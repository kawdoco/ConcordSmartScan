## 📌 Project Overview
**ConCordSmartScan** is an enterprise resource solution designed to minimize production downtime in garment factories. 

When industrial sewing machines fail, manual searches for replacements across scattered store locations cause significant delays and financial loss. This system automates the discovery process, allowing supervisors to instantly locate the nearest available replacement machine using QR code identification and geospatial logic.
